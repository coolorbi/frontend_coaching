      The term “domestic dog” refers to any of several hundred breeds of dog in
      the world today. While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every
      dog—from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a member of the same species,
      Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines, such as
      coyotes, foxes, and wolves.

      Domestic dogs are mostly kept as pets, though many breeds are capable of
      surviving on their own, whether it’s in a forest or on city streets. A
      third of all households worldwide have a dog, according to a 2016 consumer
      insights study. This makes the domestic dog the most popular pet on the
      planet.
